//In this code, I am using four variables: `myfavtplace`, `Myfavtplace`, `MyFavtplace`, and `MyFavtPlace`. Due to the case-sensitive nature of the language, these are all considered distinct variables.


var myfavtplace = "Darjeeling";
var Myfavtplace = "Kolkata";
var MyFavtplace = "hill station";
var MyFavtPlace = "Kolkata's weather";

console.log("For a long time, I have been staying in "+Myfavtplace+", but I starting to feel bored with "+MyFavtPlace+", so I decided to visit "+myfavtplace+" because I love the weather at the "+MyFavtplace+".");
